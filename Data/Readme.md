# Database Tables Folder

I like to separate the database from my application, it forces me to have separate models for inputing the data and storing it into the database, but thats a good thing since the input will be forcefully cleanned up.


The way the database was build is similar to how a bank like NuBank operates: users have accounts that have both transfer keys and trasations. a user may have multiple trasatios and keys linked to its name but transations are exclusively linked to a users and a key while keys to one user only.

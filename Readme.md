# Umbra Challenge App (06/09/2024)

Hello! i am Leonardo and this is my submission for the Umbra C# developer job opportunity. It is written using C# Blazor with pure back-end interactivity.


As i created the project i've spead around Readme.md files to explain the logic behind each decision i've taken and WHY the system is built the way it is. Some of it may be redudant specially for self explanatory sections like the login form, but that's because i wanted to make sure the app is fully understandable with the least ammount of effort possible from an incoming developer, intern or senior.


This document is writen in english but you can also ask me in portuguese (Brasil), if any decision i've taken is either confusing or could be improved please fell free to contact me in one of my main channels:
